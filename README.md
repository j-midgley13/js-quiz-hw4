## Introduction

## Criteria
-------------

Given I am taking the quiz:
<br>
When I click the start button
<br>
Then a timer starts and I am presented with a question
<br>
When I answer the question
<br>
Then I am presented with another question
<br>
When I answer a question incorrectly
<br>
Then time is subtracted from the clock
<br>
When all questions are answered or the timre reaches 0
<br>
Then the game is over
<br>
When the game is over
<br>
Then I can save my initials and score
